I was starting to make some way in with an environment project that I had been working on in my spare time. Here’s a still from the last wip that I did:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/001_cyberpunk/01.png" alt="" caption="" %}

At this point I had already locked down the blockout and initial lighting pass and was starting to consider material applications & trim sheets. There was one problem however. The modular piece were not snapping together neatly, leaving tons of micro gaps between along different kit pieces.

I went back into the monolith and had realized, a lot of the pieces weren’t aligned to the grid and some had their pivot points in all the wrong places. This was the first real lesson I had in modular design: make sure you stick to the grid as much as possible, to prevent tears later on.

An advice I’ve once received was that it’s easy to get hung up on wanting modularize everything but sometimes, you need to let that go and create custom pieces instead.

Going with that line of thinking, I rebuild the kit in Maya and started patching the gaps between the kit. Then I realized this was a great opportunity to make some design changes.

The path next to the right seating area had been bothering me a while. It was quite narrow and looked quite difficult to walk. The path on the opposite side of the bar areas was far worse. Second, the actual platform in which the bar stools are sitting on looks quite narrow as well and someone sitting there is probably going to run into a bad time sooner or later.

I decided, while I was there to make some other design changes:

* Add more height to the foreground step
* Narrow the actual bar counter
* Redesign the cornice and pillars to go for some more slightly sharper angles.
* Reduce the number of strip lighting in the foreground roof

To that end, here’s the update kit as it currently stands:

I’ve hidden the right side completely. This will make up the final primary composition for this project. Both the step up in the foreground and the step onto the bar platform feels a lot better now. The width of the counter also feels much better as people can actually reach over the counter. This did come at a cost of a smaller bar area but I can live with this.

The seating/lounge area to the left and the space immediately after the first step up remained fairly untouched, albeit a tad deeper. Also, this change in scale also meant that I get to bring the camera in a bit from an extreme wide angle to around a 24mm, which makes me pretty happy about.

This does make the space feel slightly more closed in but I think not by much. The next thing to tackle would be to reattach the roof and shelves that sit above the bar area.

Till next time.

じゃね。
